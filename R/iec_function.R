# This script defines the function "est_iec" which calculates Index of
# Ecological Condition (IEC) scores. The function "est_iec"
# ("iec_site_score" at the time) was originally used for Erin E. G. Giese's
# thesis (2012).  Giese's thesis used the script
# "IEC_Application_NoForLoopExp20120328.r" which this current function is based
# on.  The purpose of this script is to estimate IEC scores based on Biotic
# Response (BR) functions of species or other taxa for many sites at once.
# BR functions can be calculated using function "est_brc".
#
# File used for E. Giese's thesis: "IEC_Application_NoForLoopExp20120328.r"
# File "IEC_Builder20120328.r" was based on March Excel files but most closely
# resembles April files (right?  based on BRC script comments).
#
# Input:
# "method" is used to set the criteria to use for estimating IEC.  "method"
# can be set to "pa" (default), or "q".  Method "pa" is used
# where present/absence data are available, and method "q" is used if
# probability data are available.
# Note that method "pa" corresponds to the Excel tab "CalcPA" (formerly
# "CalcLik"), and method "q" corresponds to Excel tab "CalcQ" (formerly
# "CalcLSq").
#
# Note: Future versions of "est_iec" may be written so that only species in
# "brc" are used for scoring sites.
#
# Structure of function "est_iec":
# * "Error checking" ensures that input variables "sp" and "brc"
#   are both data frames, and that they contain the same species.  If any of
#   these criteria are not met, an error is raised and the function exits with
#   a message describing the issue.
# * "Declarations" contains variables that will be used later in the
#   function.  In general, these are the only variables you are likely to
#   modify in this script.
# * "Main Function" contains function "f" which returns the likelihood
#   function which is minimized by "nlminb".  Note that Dr. Howe's MS Excel
#   based versions of this function maximize this function. Because "nlminb"
#   can only minimize functions, the function here has the sign reversed
#   during analysis, but the sign is corrected before adding it to the output
#   so the numbers generated are comparable to those generated by Solver in
#   Excel.
# * "for loop over each site" contains a for loop that processes
#   each taxa in turn.  Each taxa has function "nlminb" called on it the
#   number of times specified by input variable "n_reps".  "nlminb" tries to
#   minimize the likelihood function returned by function "f".

#' Estimate IEC site scores.
#'
#' \code{est_iec} estimates the Index of Ecological Condition (IEC) for each
#' site in \code{sp} based on the biotic response curves (BRC) in \code{brc}.
#'
#' An Index of Ecological Condition (IEC) score is estimated for each site (row)
#' in data frame \code{sp}. This score is based on the Biotic Response functions
#' (curves) in \code{brc} (output from \code{\link{est_brc}}). The column names
#' in \code{sp} and column 1 of \code{brc} must contain the same taxa in the
#' same order. The default method treats observations as presence/absence
#' (\code{method = "pa"}).  Note that input records do not need to be coded as
#' presence/absence as the method simply checks for 0 or > 0. When quantitative
#' observations are available, set \code{method} to \code{q}. \code{n_reps}
#' determines the number of times the optimization function
#' (\code{\link[stats]{nlminb}}) is run with different starting values.
#' \code{n_reps} can be set to any positive integer, but the authors recommend
#' against using values of less than 10 except for testing purposes.  Larger
#' values will take longer to process.  The default value is 30.  If
#' \code{keep_zeros = TRUE} (defualt), all taxa in \code{brc} are used for
#' scoring the sites. But if \code{keep_zeros = FALSE}, only those taxa detected
#' at a given site are used to score that site.  With the latter option, the
#' number of taxa used to score each site may vary.
#'
#' @param brc BRC data frame generated by \code{\link{est_brc}}.
#' @param method one of \code{"pa"} (default; CalcPA) or \code{"q"} (CalcQ).
#' @param n_reps scalar integer setting the number of random starts for
#'   optimization (default is 30).
#' @param keep_zeros logical indicating if all taxa are used in scoring
#'   (\code{TRUE}; default) or only detected taxa.
#' @inheritParams est_brc
#' @return A data frame containing the IEC scores for each site in \code{sp} and
#'   the corresponding likelihood of the score.
