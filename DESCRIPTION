Description: This package provides a suite of functions for calculating the
    Index of Ecological Condition (IEC), a biotic indicator of ecological
    health first described by Howe et al. (2007a,b) and modified by us for
    Giese et al. (2014). Calculation of an IEC involves two steps 1) modeling
    responses of species to a reference gradient or quantitative environmental
    stressor (typically completed by prior research) and 2) calculating IEC
    values for new sites based occurrences (e.g., presence/absence, abundance,
    frequency) of multiple species or taxonomic groups at the site. The method
    applies an iterative maximum likelihood approach for calculating both
    species response functions and IEC values. Functions for calculating the
    biotic responses to environmental stressors (BR models) are useful as
    stand-alone applications of environmental gradient analysis.
